        <p>I am a wife, a mother, and a woman in software development—a dynamic balance of personal
            and professional
            roles. At home, I nurture my family with love and patience, creating a supportive
            environment where my children can thrive and her partnership flourishes. In my
            professional life,
            I navigate the fast-paced and ever-evolving world of software development, bringing
            creativity, logic, and determination to every project I undertake. My journey reflects
            the
            harmony of ambition and care, showing that dedication to one’s career and devotion to
            family are
            not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary facets of a purposeful life.</p>

        <h2>Lagos, Nigeria</h2>
        <img src="images/lagos-city.jpg" alt="A town in lagos" width="200">
        <p>Lagos is Nigeria’s vibrant commercial heart, pulsing with energy, ambition, and
            creativity. The city
            blends bustling markets, modern skyscrapers, and lively beaches along the Atlantic
            coast. Its
            diverse population fuels music, fashion, technology, and entrepreneurship, while
            constant traffic
            and noise reflect resilience. Lagos thrives on chaos, opportunity, and an unstoppable
            spirit that
            defines urban African life for millions daily residents.
